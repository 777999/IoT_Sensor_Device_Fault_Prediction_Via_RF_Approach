# IoT_sensor_Fault_Prediciton_Uisng_Random_Forest_Classifier

IoT Smart or sensor devices work together through a wireless communication infrastructure to track or monitor environments, or physical conditions such as sound, temperature, vibration, pressure, or pollutants. The network allows the sensors to cooperatively transmit their data to a central location where the data can be observed and analyzed. The sensor network provides the end-user or the administrator with a platform so they can observe and be able to react to events or circumstances taking place in the specific environment. However, these smart or sensor devices can be faulty due to their hardware components failing, battery life depletion, or human errors, which negatively affect the network since the device can disconnect or cause malfunctions on the network. Consequently, erroneous data can be transmitted, sometimes leading to unwanted overheads on the network. Therefore, predicting and detecting faulty sensor devices in IoT plays an important role in the quality of service and reliability of the network. 

Requirements:
